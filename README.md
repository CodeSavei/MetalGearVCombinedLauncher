# MetalGearVCombinedLauncher

This is a simple launcher written in Java that provides a cool opening menu from where you can select either game: Act 1-Ground Zeroes or Act 2-Phantom Pain or exit.

Steps to use:
1. Download the zip from the releases tab.
2. Extract and run the MGSVLauncher.exe, this will generate a config.properties file near the exe.
3. Quit the launcher and set your path of each game's SHORTCUT(.lnk) in config file. If there's no shortcut of the game, create one near the exe file.
4. Note: Path name should be formatted as in this example: ground.zeroes.path=C:\\AdiGames\\Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes\\MgsGroundZeroes.exe.lnk     phantom.pain.path=C:\\AdiGames\\Metal Gear Solid V - The Phantom Pain\\mgsvtpp.exe.lnk
